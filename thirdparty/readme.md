# Third Party

Thirdparty is a folder that will contain any third party packages that is used in gocunets.  For the most part I won't be making any changes to the packages.  I will update the packages if there is a new one and I feel that it will be in the best interest of GoCuNets to have it updated.

I might add gocudnn into here because it is a major package. I haven't decided yet.
